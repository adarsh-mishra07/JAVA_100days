What is Inheritance?
Inheritance means acquiring the properties and behaviors (variables & methods) of one class into another.
It helps us reuse code and maintain hierarchy among classes.

class Parent {
   // parent class code
}

class Child extends Parent {
   // child class code
}

Types of Inheritance in Java

Single Inheritance
→ One class inherits from another.
A → B

Multilevel Inheritance
→ Class C inherits from B, which inherits from A.
A → B → C

Hierarchical Inheritance
→ Multiple classes inherit from one base class.
A → B, C

⚠️ Note: Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance (like class C extends A, B) because it creates ambiguity.
