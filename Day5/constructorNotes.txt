What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special method that initializes an object when it is created.

*  It has the same name as the class.

It does not have a return type, not even void.
It is automatically called when we create an object using new.

*  Types of Constructors:

1. Default Constructor: Created automatically by Java if no constructor is defined.

2. Parameterized Constructor: Used when we need to initialize objects with specific values.

3. Copy Constructor: Used to create a new object by copying another object (manually written in Java).


Constructor Overloading:
We can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists — this is known as constructor overloading.


What I Understood

Constructors automatically run when an object is created.
They help make our code cleaner, safer, and more organized.
Constructor overloading gives flexibility to initialize objects differently based on need.
